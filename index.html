          <a id="about"></a><h2 class="featurette-heading">About Lo Fi Coffee</h2<
          <p class="lead"><h3>What It's All About</h3>
          <p>Lo Fi Coffee has been a work in progress and will always be a work in progress.  The whole idea started on a cold night in December of 2010 with a meeting between Sam Clark the owner and The Nile Theater about opening up a coffee cart inside of the "front room" of The Nile.  The coffee cart idea evolved into a coffee shop eventually and thus the idea for Lo Fi was born.  We turned a dark lonely store front on Main St. into a lively coffee shop ready to serve the masses!  on June 14th of 2011 Lo Fi first flipped the open signs.  It was 110 degrees and not ideal weather for drinking a hot cup of joe.  We've since expanded into a second location at The Hive on 16th Street in Phoenix, and are soon to be moving in at Grand Avenue with The Trunk Space.</p>
          <h3>The Name</h3>
          <p>"Lo Fi Coffee" comes from the term low fidelity.  Low Fidelity is often a term related to vinyl records describing the scratched and flaw sound one always hears.  We took the idea and ingrained into the coffee shop.  No business is perfect and we don't want to be perfect!  We just want to be a coffee shop that is always striving for excellence while maintaining a degree of uniqueness!  We aim to be just what we want to be nothing more and nothing less.  Our employees have their own personalities and so does the coffee shop as it builds around them.  Never be surprised to hear punk rock on the stereo or some soft country music.  We also live in the same building as music venues, so often you will hear the low fidelity sound of a sound check for a concert happening that very evening!</p>
          <h3>Our Take On Coffee</h3>
          <p>Coffee is the keystone of our business, it is what we live for.  We strive to make sure the customer enjoys every cup of our own personal recipes.  We take the culinary approach in our coffee.  Coffee houses are very similar to restaurants; similiar, but never the same.  Our methodology is based on the idea of serving the customer the best possible drink with coffee always being the priority.  We will go above and beyond to make sure the customer gets what they want, but we follow guidelines to ensure that the flavor of our coffee is always preserved.  While there are corporate chain coffee shops that aim to standardize the industry we will always work to make sure that every shop has its own personal flair.  Traditional names, terminology, and recipes are used in the coffee shop.</p>
          <p>Science is crucial to what we do.  Instead of adjusting our drinks on "shots" or any other sort of informal mathmatics, we break it down.  When trying to find out what tastes best with our espresso we gauge by grams.  Not all espressos are created equal!  We acknowledge this, and aim to always provide the best possible product!  Our drip coffee is always made by hand!  Sometimes we may offer a pot of coffee, but we will always let you know when we do!</p>
          <h3>Handmade Drinks!</h3>
          <p>Handmade is what we're all about!  We always want to make sure that every customer gets the very best of what we have to offer!  From a large iced drink with syrup to the cup of black coffee.  We always make our drinks by hand, and never by automation.  If you request something different in your drink, then you'll get it!  We are here to make sure you get a custom-tailored option with your product, and you leave with the best!</p>
          <h3>About The Roaster</h3>
          <p>Lo Fi Coffee has actually been roasting for five years!  Randall Denton Partner/Owner originally began with Xanadu Coffee, this and a strong passion.  Randall has a strong work ethic and it is a huge portion of what drives Lo Fi Coffee.</p>
